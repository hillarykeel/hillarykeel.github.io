				<h2>The State of Things</h2>
				    <p>Hillary has cancer. All doctors say it is difficult to treat and that it is terminal. Hillary is physically weak, but mentally sharp. The situation is hard, but she has the support of her immidiate family. Hillary is currently (October 4th) in the <a href="https://www.caritasklinikum.de/"> St. Theresia Caritas Hospital</a> in Saarbruecken in German, but will come home to Paul's place in the next day or so.</p><br>
					
				
					
					<h2>How to Help</h2>
				    <p>Please send your love, thoughts, prayers. The fastest way to contact her is per WhatsApp. Sophie and myself also appreceate all messages. If you do not receive a reaction, please understand that we are all overwhelmed, but we are all greatful when we feel that we are not alone.
					
					<br>	You could also send her a postcard to Pauls home address:</p>
					
					<blockquote>
					 Hillary Strohmeier c/o Paul Strohmeier <br>
					Lessingstr. 24 <br>
					66121 Saarbrucken <br>
					Germany					</blockquote>
					
					<h2>How to Help Financially</h2>
					 <p>As Hillary is still covered by Austrian insurance, we were able to minimize costs associated with medical treatment. However, events have -- naturally -- disrupted her financial plans. Hillary has no savings to speak of and a mortgage which she intended to pay off over the course of the next years. She will not be able to do this and is upset about the idea of leaving us, her children, to deal with it. We also, do not have a good idea of what additional financial issues will await us -- for example, I intend to organize a professional care-taker to help ensure her quality of life once she is back home with us. Any financial support is appreceated. </p>
					 
					  <p>Ways to do this include sending money directly to Hillary via Zelle:</p>
					  
					  		<blockquote>
					hillary[dot]keel[at]gmail.com
					</blockquote>
					  
					 <p>Sending money to her Daughter Sophie via PayPal </p>

					<blockquote>
					sophie[dot]strohmeier[at]gmail.com (please select "friends and family" to avoid fees)
					</blockquote>
					
					 <p>Or (for people in Europe) a direct Bank Transfer to me -- Paul, her Son</p>
					 
					 	<blockquote>
					Please request bank details via e-mail paul[dot]strohmeier[at]gmail.com
					</blockquote>
					
					<h2>Celibrate Hillary</h2>
					There will be a reading in celebration of Hillary <br> in Tompins Square Library on October 22nd, 2pm.
