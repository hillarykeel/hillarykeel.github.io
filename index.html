				<h2>The State of Things</h2>
				    <p>Hillary has cancer. All doctors say it is difficult to treat and that it is incurable. Hillary is physically weak, but mentally sharp. The situation is hard, but she has the support of her  immediate family. Hillary is currently (October 4th) in the <a href="https://www.caritasklinikum.de/"> St. Theresia Caritas Hospital</a> in Saarbrücken in German, but will (hopefully!) come home to Paul's place in the next day or so.</p><br>
					
				
					
					<h2>How to Help</h2>
				    <p>Please send your love, thoughts, prayers. The fastest way to contact her is per WhatsApp. Sophie and Paul also appreciate  all messages. If you do not receive a reaction, please understand that we are all overwhelmed, but we are all grateful  when we feel that we are not alone.
					
					<br>	You could also send her a postcard to Paul's home address:</p>
					
					<blockquote>
					 Hillary Strohmeier c/o Paul Strohmeier <br>
					Lessingstr. 24 <br>
					66121 Saarbrucken <br>
					Germany					</blockquote>
					
					<h2>How to Help Financially</h2>
					 <p>As Hillary is still covered by Austrian insurance, we were able to minimize all costs associated with medical treatment going forward. However, Hillary spent 8 days in the ICU at Beth Israel and 5 days at the ICU of Wayne Memorial Hospital -- these bills have yet to arrive. We have received conflicting information regarding her insurance status: It appears that Hillary lost all benefits connected to her job at Hunter College from the moment she announced her medical leave.
					 <br><br>
					 
					 Hillary's overall financial planning is of course also disrupted. Hillary has no savings to speak of and a mortgage which she intended to pay off over the course of the next few years. She will not be able to do this and is devastated by the idea of leaving us, her children, to deal with it. 
					 <br><br>
					 
					 Finally, we do not have a good idea of what additional financial challenges will await us -- for example, I intend to organize a professional care-taker to help ensure her quality of life once she is back home with us. Any financial support is appreciated. </p>
					 
					 
					  <p>Ways to do this include sending money directly to Hillary via <b>Zelle</b>:</p>
					  
					  		<blockquote>	<b>hillary[dot]keel[at]gmail.com	</b>	</blockquote>
					  
					 <p>Sending money to her daughter Sophie via <b>PayPal</b> </p>

					<blockquote>
					<b>sophie[dot]strohmeier[at]gmail.com </b>(please select "friends and family" to avoid fees)
					</blockquote>
					
					 <p><b>Direct Bank Transfer</b> to either a US bank account or european bank account</p>
					 
					 	<blockquote>
					Please contact me via e-mail for account details <b> paul[dot]strohmeier[at]gmail.com</b>
					</blockquote>
					For checks, you can also contact Sophie and she will provide her physical address in Brooklyn. 
					<br><br>
					We will publish a running tally of money received here, and we will add a list of people who contributed money (please indicate to us if you wish to be included in this list and if you wish to have the sum you contributed known).
					<br><br><br>
					
					<h2>Celebrate Hillary</h2>
					There will be a reading in celebration of Hillary <br> in Tompkins Square Library on October 22nd, 2pm.
